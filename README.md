**Hi, my name is Nick Lawee.**

- I'm a passionate data analyst with a love for problem-solving and creating solutions. My journey in the world of coding started during discovery of Econometrics (utilizing R) in University, and I've been hooked ever since. I thrive on learning and exploring new technologies to stay at the forefront of this ever-evolving field.
  
- I have a Bachelor's degree in Economics and looking to focus in a more data-driven/technical role.

- Let's connect and grow together! Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chan-lawee) for discussions, collaborations, or just to say hi. I'm always open to connecting with like-minded individuals.
